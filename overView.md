Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî I‚Äôll update your prompt to reflect the simplified model you want. This version removes detailed item-level sales/purchases, excludes stock tracking, and instead focuses on totals, ending stock, financial position, and cash management (including transfers between hand & bank).

Here‚Äôs the refined prompt you can paste into Claude:
