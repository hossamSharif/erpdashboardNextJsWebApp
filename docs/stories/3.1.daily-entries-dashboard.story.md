# Story 3.1: Daily Entries Dashboard

## Status
approved

## Story
**As a** shop worker,
**I want** to land on a daily entries dashboard after login,
**so that** I can immediately see and manage today's transactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1: Dashboard opens automatically post-authentication showing current date
2: Top status bar displays real-time cash-in-hand and bank balances
3: Quick stats widget shows today's totals (sales, purchases, expenses)
4: Transaction list displays in descending order (newest first)
5: Each entry shows type indicator with color coding (green/red/orange)
6: Edit and delete buttons available on each entry
7: Empty state message when no entries for selected date
8: Auto-refresh when returning from transaction modal

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.6 (Expense Category Configuration) established the expense category system that will be referenced in transaction displays. Categories are stored with bilingual names (nameAr/nameEn) and support hierarchical structures.

### Data Models
**Shop Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Shop]
- Contains `id` for shopId filtering in all queries
- Bilingual naming: `nameAr`, `nameEn`
- Multi-tenant isolation through shopId

**Transaction Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Transaction]
- Core fields: `id`, `type` (SALES/PURCHASE/EXPENSE/TRANSFER), `amount`, `amountPaid`, `change`
- `transactionDate` for date filtering
- `description` for transaction details
- `shopId` for multi-tenant filtering (CRITICAL: Every query must include)
- `isSynced` and `syncedAt` for sync status
- Relationships: `shop`, `user`, `account`, `counterAccount`

**User Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User]
- `shopId` links user to their assigned shop
- `role` enum: ADMIN or USER
- `lastSyncAt` for tracking sync status

### API Specifications
**shops.getDashboard** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#shops.getDashboard]
- Input: `{ shopId: string, date?: Date }`
- Returns: `{ cashBalance, bankBalance, todayStats: { sales, purchases, expenses }, pendingSyncCount, lastSyncAt }`

**transactions.getDaily** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#transactions.getDaily]
- Input: `{ shopId: string, date: Date }`
- Returns: Array of Transaction objects with all relationships

### Component Specifications
**Frontend Component Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component-Organization]
- Dashboard components go in `apps/web/src/components/features/dashboard/`
- Shared UI components from `apps/web/src/components/ui/`
- Use shadcn/ui components as base (Button, Card, etc.)

**State Management** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State-Management-Architecture]
- Zustand store pattern established
- Dashboard store should follow AppState structure
- Include offline status tracking

### File Locations
- Dashboard page: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`
- Dashboard layout: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- Dashboard components: `apps/web/src/components/features/dashboard/`
- Dashboard store: `apps/web/src/stores/dashboard-store.ts`
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/dashboard/`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/pages/`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests using Vitest + React Testing Library
- Test files adjacent to components or in tests/ directory
- Arabic text support in tests required
- Use mock tRPC client for API testing
- Test offline scenarios and sync states

### Technical Constraints
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: EVERY database query must include shopId [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use shared types from packages/shared [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **API Calls**: Only use tRPC client, never direct HTTP [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Arabic Support**: All UI strings must have translations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Date Handling**: Use date-fns for formatting [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate state directly [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `apps/web/tests/` directory structure
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- Test patterns: Follow existing test patterns from stories 1.x and 2.x
- Arabic testing: Include RTL layout tests and Arabic text rendering
- Mock data: Use factory functions for consistent test data
- Coverage requirements: Minimum 80% code coverage for new components
