## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 2.1 (Shop Creation):** [Source: docs/stories/2.1.shop-creation-management.md]
- Shop data model and tRPC infrastructure is established
- Multi-tenant data isolation patterns are implemented with shopId filtering
- Bilingual naming patterns (Arabic/English) are established for all entities
- Soft delete patterns using isActive field are implemented
- Form validation using React Hook Form + Zod is established

### Data Models
**FinancialYear Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#financialyear]
- id: string (UUID) - Unique financial year identifier
- name: string - Financial year display name
- startDate: DateTime - Year start date
- endDate: DateTime - Year end date
- openingStockValue: Decimal - Stock value at year start (for profit calculations)
- closingStockValue: Decimal - Stock value at year end (null until closed)
- isCurrent: boolean - Active financial year flag (only one per shop)
- isClosed: boolean - Year closure status (prevents new transactions)
- shopId: string - Shop context for multi-tenant isolation
- Relationships: Belongs to Shop, Has many Transactions

**Transaction Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#transaction]
- financialYearId: string - Required relationship to FinancialYear
- All transactions must be linked to a financial year
- Transactions cannot be created in closed financial years
- Financial year context affects transaction queries and reporting

### API Specifications
**Financial Year tRPC Router** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
```typescript
// apps/api/src/server/routers/financialYear.ts
export const financialYearRouter = router({
  create: adminProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      name: z.string().min(1),
      startDate: z.date(),
      endDate: z.date(),
      openingStockValue: z.number().nonnegative(),
      shopId: z.string()
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Create financial year with validation
      // Ensure no overlapping years for shop
      // Set as current if no current year exists
    }),

  list: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ shopId: z.string() }))
    .query(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Return financial years for shop
      // Include transaction counts for each year
    }),

  setCurrent: adminProcedure
    .input(z.object({ id: z.string() }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Set as current year (only one per shop)
      // Validate year is not closed
    }),

  close: adminProcedure
    .input(z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      closingStockValue: z.number().nonnegative()
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Close financial year with validation
      // Generate carry-forward entries for next year
      // Prevent if no next year exists
    })
});
```

**Financial Year Validation Service** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#multi-tenant-isolation]
- All financial year operations must include shopId filtering
- Prevent overlapping financial years per shop
- Ensure only one current financial year per shop
- Validate transactions against financial year status

### Component Specifications
**Financial Year Management Components** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- FinancialYearForm: `apps/web/src/components/features/financial-years/FinancialYearForm.tsx`

- Financial year routing: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/financial-years/` directory
- Use shadcn/ui components (Table, Card, Dialog, Form, DatePicker)

**Date Handling Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use date-fns library for date manipulation and formatting
- Support Arabic calendar display alongside Gregorian
- Implement proper date validation for financial year periods
- Handle timezone considerations for year-end dates

- FinancialYear table already defined in Prisma schema
- Unique constraint on (shopId, isCurrent) ensures only one current year per shop
- Transaction table with financialYearId foreign key for year linking
- Proper indexing on shopId and isCurrent for performance

### Testing Requirements
**Financial Year Management Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests: Financial year router procedures, closing service logic
- Integration tests: Complete financial year lifecycle with transaction integration
- Component tests: FinancialYearForm validation, year switching functionality
- E2E tests: Financial year closing workflow, year-end warning system
- Test file locations: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/financial-years/`, `apps/api/tests/unit/routers/`

**Multi-tenant Testing** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#multi-tenant-isolation]
- Every database query must include shopId filtering
- Test financial year isolation between shops
- Validate financial year context in all tRPC procedures
- Test current year switching does not affect other shops

**Date and Time Testing** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test financial year date overlap validation
- Test year-end date calculations and warnings
- Test opening balance carry-forward calculations
- Validate Arabic date display formatting

### Technical Constraints
**Multi-tenant Data Isolation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All database queries must include shopId filtering
- Financial year context must be passed through tRPC procedures
- User authorization based on shop assignments for financial year operations

**Business Logic Constraints** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#financialyear]
- Only one current financial year per shop allowed
- Financial years cannot overlap within the same shop
- Transactions cannot be created in closed financial years
- Closing stock value must be provided before year can be closed

**Type Safety** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Define types in packages/shared and import
- Use tRPC client for type-safe API calls
- No direct HTTP calls - always use tRPC service layer

## Testing
