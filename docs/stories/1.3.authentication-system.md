## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.2 (Database Schema & Multi-tenant Setup):** [Source: docs/stories/1.2.database-schema-multi-tenant-setup.md]
- Complete Prisma schema available with User model including role (ADMIN/USER) and shopId assignment
- Password field ready for bcrypt hashing with 12 rounds
- Multi-tenant isolation implemented with shopId filtering
- User model includes email authentication field and shop relationship
- Database migrations created and tested for user authentication

### Data Models
**User Authentication Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
- User entity with email (string), role (UserRole enum: ADMIN/USER), shopId (string)
- Bilingual naming support: nameAr (string), nameEn (string)
- Account status: isActive (boolean), lastSyncAt (DateTime)
- Authentication relationships: belongs to one Shop, has many Transactions

**Shop Model for User Assignment** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#shop]
- Shop entity with id (UUID), nameAr/nameEn (bilingual names), isActive status
- ownerId reference for admin assignment
- Relationships: has many Users for multi-user shop access

### API Specifications
**tRPC Authentication Router** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#trpc-router-definitions]
- authRouter.signIn procedure: input validation for email, password, optional shopId
- authRouter.getSession procedure: returns current user session
- authRouter.updateProfile and changePassword procedures for user management
- Input validation using Zod schemas for type safety

**Authentication Flow** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#auth-flow]
- Client → API Gateway → Auth Service → Database validation sequence
- JWT tokens + User data response pattern
- Shop context validation during authentication

### Component Specifications
**Frontend Authentication Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]
- Zustand store structure: user (User | null), isAuthenticated (boolean), currentShop (Shop | null)
- Authentication state actions: setUser, logout methods
- User interface state: language ('ar' | 'en'), theme settings

**Component Organization** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- Base UI components location: `apps/web/src/components/ui/`
- Authentication components: `apps/web/src/components/features/auth/`
- Layout components: `apps/web/src/components/layout/` (header, sidebar, rtl-provider)

### File Locations
**Authentication Implementation Paths** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Next.js API Routes: `apps/web/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- tRPC Auth Router: `apps/api/src/server/routers/auth.ts`
- Login Page: `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`
- Auth Layout: `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx`
- Auth Components: `apps/web/src/components/features/auth/`
- Auth Store: `apps/web/src/stores/auth-store.ts`
- Auth Middleware: `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`

**Shared Types and Validation** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Shared auth types: `packages/shared/src/types/auth.ts`
- Auth validators: `packages/shared/src/validators/auth.ts`
- Shared constants: `packages/shared/src/constants/auth.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Authentication Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- NextAuth.js 4.24+ for authentication and authorization
- JWT tokens for session management
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Redis (Upstash) 7+ for session storage and rate limiting
- tRPC 10.45+ for end-to-end type-safe API calls

**Rate Limiting Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Redis-based rate limiting for login attempts
- Maximum 5 login attempts per 15-minute window per IP/email
- Rate limiting implementation in API middleware

**Multi-tenant Security Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Every database query must include shopId filtering
- Users can only access data from their assigned shop
- Admin users can access multiple shops they own
- Type sharing through packages/shared for consistency

### Testing Requirements
**Authentication Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/auth/` for login components
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/auth/` for full login flow
- E2E tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts` for complete user journey

**Test Examples Pattern** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
```typescript
// Test Arabic/English interface switching
test('should handle login in Arabic mode', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.click('button:has-text("تسجيل الدخول")');
  // Verify Arabic success message
});

// Test role-based access
describe('AuthMiddleware', () => {
  it('should restrict admin routes to admin users', () => {
    expect(adminRoute).toRejectWithRole('USER');
  });
});
```

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test multi-tenant isolation: verify users can only access their shop data
- Test session management: timeout, refresh, persistence
- Test Arabic RTL interface: proper layout and text direction
- Test role-based access controls for different user types

## Testing
**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- Frontend authentication tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/auth/` and `apps/web/tests/integration/auth/`
- Backend authentication tests: `apps/api/tests/unit/auth/` and `apps/api/tests/integration/auth/`
- E2E authentication flow tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts`

**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Backend Testing: Vitest + Supertest for API endpoint testing
- E2E Testing: Playwright 1.40+ for cross-browser authentication flows

**Authentication Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test login/logout functionality with role-based access
- Verify session timeout and automatic refresh
- Test Arabic/English interface switching during authentication
- Verify multi-tenant isolation for shop access
- Test rate limiting for login attempts
- Test password encryption and validation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Story Status:** Ready for Review → Requires Additional Work

**Implementation Quality:** The authentication system has been implemented with comprehensive features covering all acceptance criteria, but there are significant gaps that prevent this from being production-ready.

### Acceptance Criteria Assessment

✅ **AC1 - NextAuth.js with JWT Strategy**: Fully implemented with proper session configuration and 8-hour timeout
✅ **AC2 - Bilingual Login Page**: Complete Arabic/English interface with RTL support
✅ **AC3 - Role-based Authentication**: ADMIN/USER roles properly implemented
✅ **AC4 - Shop Selection**: Shop assignment logic working for user logins
⚠️ **AC5 - Session Management**: Basic implementation present but lacks production features
❌ **AC6 - Password Encryption**: Using bcrypt but with hardcoded test passwords
❌ **AC7 - Rate Limiting**: Memory-based rate limiting (non-persistent)
✅ **AC8 - Logout Functionality**: Implemented with proper session cleanup

### Critical Issues Found

**Security Issues:**
- **SEC-001**: Authentication uses hardcoded mock users instead of database integration
- **SEC-002**: Rate limiting uses in-memory storage, resets on server restart
- **SEC-003**: No actual database password verification implemented

**Implementation Gaps:**
- **REQ-001**: Missing database integration despite Prisma schema being available
- **REQ-002**: tRPC auth procedures not fully implemented (updateProfile, changePassword)
- **REQ-003**: Missing environment variable validation and setup

**Testing Coverage:**
- **TEST-001**: Only unit tests present, missing integration and E2E test execution
- **TEST-002**: Tests mock all external dependencies instead of testing real flows

### Positive Findings

- Complete bilingual UI implementation with proper RTL support
- Comprehensive NextAuth.js configuration with proper JWT handling
- Well-structured component architecture following project patterns
- Good error handling and loading states in UI components
- Proper TypeScript integration with shared types
- Security-conscious middleware implementation for route protection

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Replace mock user data with actual Prisma database queries
2. **Immediate**: Implement Redis-based rate limiting for production persistence
3. **Before Production**: Add environment variable validation and configuration checks
4. **Before Production**: Complete tRPC auth procedures implementation
5. **Testing**: Execute integration and E2E tests to verify complete authentication flows
