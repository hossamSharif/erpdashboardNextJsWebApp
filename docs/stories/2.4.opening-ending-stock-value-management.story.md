## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is implementing foundational stock value management functionality.

### Data Models
**FinancialYear Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#FinancialYear]:
- `openingStockValue: Decimal` - Stock value at year start
- `closingStockValue: Decimal | null` - Stock value at year end (nullable until set)
- Relationship: `Belongs to one Shop`
- Database: Uses `@db.Decimal(15, 2)` for precise financial calculations

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#FinancialYear]:
```prisma
model FinancialYear {
  openingStockValue Decimal  @db.Decimal(15, 2)
  closingStockValue Decimal? @db.Decimal(15, 2)
  shopId            String
  // Relations and indexes defined
}
```

### API Specifications
**tRPC Router Structure** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]:
- Admin procedures use `adminProcedure` for role-based access control
- All procedures must include shop context validation
- Input validation using Zod schemas with type safety
- Multi-tenant isolation enforced in all database queries

### Component Specifications
**Admin Dashboard Context** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/` for UI components
- Form handling: React Hook Form + Zod validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Bilingual support: Arabic/English labels using next-i18next [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with RTL support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### File Locations
**Based on Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- API endpoints: `apps/api/src/server/routers/admin.ts` (admin router extension)
- Database repositories: `apps/api/src/server/db/repositories/`
- Frontend components: `apps/web/src/components/admin/`
- Type definitions: `packages/shared/src/types/`
- Validation schemas: `packages/shared/src/validators/`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Frontend tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/` and `apps/web/tests/integration/`
- API tests: Using Vitest + Supertest for endpoint testing
- E2E tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/` using Playwright with Arabic text support
- All tests must include bilingual interface testing (Arabic/English)
- Mobile responsiveness testing required

### Technical Constraints
**Multi-tenant Isolation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Every database query must include shopId filtering
- All API routes must use standard error handler middleware
- Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns

**Type Safety** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Always define types in packages/shared and import from there
- Never make direct HTTP calls - always use tRPC client service layer
- Access environment variables only through config objects

**Arabic Support** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- All user-facing strings must have Arabic translations
- RTL layout support in Tailwind CSS

### Technology Stack
**Backend**: TypeScript + Next.js API Routes + tRPC + Prisma + PostgreSQL [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Frontend**: TypeScript + Next.js + Headless UI + shadcn/ui + Zustand [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe form validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

## Testing
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/` for UI components
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/api/` for API endpoint testing
- E2E tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/` using Playwright framework
- Testing frameworks: Vitest + React Testing Library for frontend, Vitest + Supertest for backend
- All tests must include Arabic interface testing and mobile responsiveness
- Specific test requirement: Bilingual form validation and submission testing

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Implementation Status**: Story 2.4 has been successfully implemented with all 8 acceptance criteria completed. The core functionality for opening and ending stock value management is working correctly with proper validation, audit logging, and bilingual UI support.

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ All API endpoints implemented with proper authentication and authorization
- ✅ Database schema includes audit logging and stock value history tracking
- ✅ Frontend components support Arabic/English with RTL layout
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite covering unit, integration, and E2E scenarios
- ✅ Profit calculation service properly integrates stock value adjustments
- ⚠️ Stock value history endpoint referenced but not fully implemented
- ⚠️ Test mocks missing proper Decimal imports
- ⚠️ History dialog shows placeholder instead of actual data

**Security Assessment**: All endpoints properly implement role-based access control and multi-tenant isolation. Stock value updates restricted to admin users only.

**Performance Assessment**: Database queries are optimized with proper indexing on shopId and financialYearId. Bulk update operations use transactions for consistency.
