## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 1.4 (Internationalization Setup):** [Source: docs/stories/1.4.internationalization-setup.md]
- i18next configuration with Arabic as default language is implemented
- RTL Provider component available at `apps/web/src/components/layout/rtl-provider.tsx`
- Language Toggle component available at `apps/web/src/components/layout/language-toggle.tsx`
- Arabic fonts (Cairo, Tajawal) configured and ready for use
- Translation files structure established in `apps/web/public/locales/`
- All UI components tested for RTL layout compatibility

### Data Models
**Health Check Data Structure** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- No specific health check data model defined in architecture docs
- System status should include: database connectivity, authentication service status, API response times
- Health check response should follow standard tRPC response format

**User Session Data** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#user]
- User model includes: id, email, nameAr, nameEn, role, shopId, isActive, lastSyncAt
- Authentication status indicator should display current user session state
- Role-based access (ADMIN/USER) should be reflected in status display

### API Specifications
**tRPC Router Structure** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
- Health check endpoint should be added to appRouter structure
- Follow existing tRPC patterns: `publicProcedure` for health check (no auth required)
- Response format: `{ status: 'healthy' | 'unhealthy', database: boolean, auth: boolean, responseTime: number }`
- Error handling: Use standard tRPC error handling middleware

**Health Check Router Implementation** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
```typescript
// Add to appRouter
health: healthRouter,

// Health router definition
export const healthRouter = router({
  check: publicProcedure
    .query(async ({ ctx }) => {
      // Database connectivity test
      // Auth service status
      // Response time measurement
      return healthStatus;
    }),
});
```

### Component Specifications
**Landing Page Component Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- Landing page component location: `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` (App Router root page)
- Health status components: `apps/web/src/components/features/health/health-status.tsx`
- Use existing RTL Provider and Language Toggle components
- Follow existing layout structure with header integration

**Mobile App Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Mobile app location: `apps/mobile/` with Expo React Native setup
- Health check screen: `apps/mobile/src/screens/health-check.tsx`
- Navigation setup: `apps/mobile/src/navigation/` with Expo Router
- Shared tRPC client: Use packages/shared for API types

### File Locations

### Testing Requirements
**Health Check Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- API endpoint tests: Test health check logic and error handling
- Component tests: Test landing page rendering and status indicators
- Integration tests: Test health check polling and real-time updates
- E2E tests: Test full health check flow including mobile app

**Testing Framework and Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Frontend Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing
- Backend Testing: Vitest + Supertest for API endpoint testing
- E2E Testing: Playwright 1.40+ for cross-browser testing
- Mobile Testing: Jest + React Native Testing Library

**Example Testing Patterns** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
```typescript
// Health check API test
describe('Health Check API', () => {
  it('should return healthy status when all systems operational', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/api/trpc/health.check')
      .expect(200);

    expect(response.body.result.data.status).toBe('healthy');
    expect(response.body.result.data.database).toBe(true);
  });
});

// Landing page test
describe('Landing Page', () => {
  it('should display system status in Arabic', async () => {
    render(<LandingPage />, { locale: 'ar' });
    expect(screen.getByText('النظام يعمل')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(document.documentElement).toHaveAttribute('dir', 'rtl');
  });
});
```
