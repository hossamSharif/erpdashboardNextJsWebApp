## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story context available - this is the first story being created.

### Data Models
**Account Entity [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Account]:**
- Interface: Account with id, code, nameAr, nameEn, accountType, level, parentId, shopId, isSystemAccount, isActive
- AccountType enum: ASSET, LIABILITY, EQUITY, REVENUE, EXPENSE
- 3-level hierarchy: level 1=main, 2=sub, 3=detail
- Self-referencing relationship: parent/children accounts
- Shop isolation: all accounts belong to a specific shop

### API Specifications
**tRPC Endpoints [Source: architecture/components.md#API Gateway]:**
- All API calls must use tRPC client service layer - never direct HTTP calls
- Type-safe API calls with end-to-end TypeScript integration
- API routes follow kebab-case naming convention

### Component Specifications
**UI Components [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Organization]:**
- Base UI components location: `apps/web/src/components/ui/`
- Feature components location: `apps/web/src/components/features/accounts/`
- Use shadcn/ui + Headless UI for accessible components with RTL support
- Component naming: PascalCase (e.g., `AccountHierarchyTree.tsx`)

### File Locations
**Based on Project Structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:**
- Account page: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/accounts/page.tsx`
- Account components: `apps/web/src/components/features/accounts/`
- Account types: `packages/shared/src/types/` (import from shared package)
- Account services: `apps/web/src/services/`
- Account hooks: `apps/web/src/hooks/`

### Testing Requirements
**Test Organization [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend Tests]:**
- Unit tests location: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/`
- Integration tests location: `apps/web/tests/integration/`
- Test framework: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Arabic text testing support required
- Component test pattern: describe block with specific Arabic/English scenarios

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2+ with App Router
- UI: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ with RTL support
- State: Zustand 4.4+ for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod for validation
- Icons: Lucide React + Heroicons (RTL-aware)
- Internationalization: next-i18next + react-i18next for Arabic/English

**Coding Standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:**
- Type sharing: Always import types from packages/shared
- Multi-tenant isolation: Every query must include shopId filtering
- Arabic support: All user-facing strings must have Arabic translations
- State management: Never mutate state directly
- Component naming: PascalCase for components
- Hook naming: camelCase with 'use' prefix

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- Test file location: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/accounts/`
- Test framework: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Arabic text support required in tests
- Test both Arabic and English interface modes
- Test accessibility compliance (WAI-ARIA)
- Test RTL layout behavior
- Component tests must verify bilingual display
- Integration tests for tRPC API interaction

- ✅ All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive UI components
- ✅ Bilingual support (Arabic/English) properly implemented
- ✅ Account hierarchy tree with 3-level structure working correctly
- ✅ Search functionality supports both languages and account codes
- ✅ Account management forms with validation implemented
- ✅ Circular relationship validation in place
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with Arabic/English language coverage
- ✅ RTL support and accessibility compliance
- ✅ Proper component organization and type safety

**Technical Implementation:**
- Component architecture follows shadcn/ui design system standards
- Type definitions properly shared via packages/shared
- Mock data structure demonstrates proper account hierarchy
- Search highlighting and filtering works as expected
- Account type indicators and badges implemented correctly

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Mock data still in use instead of tRPC integration
- Turbo configuration uses deprecated pipeline field
- Missing integration tests for API interactions
