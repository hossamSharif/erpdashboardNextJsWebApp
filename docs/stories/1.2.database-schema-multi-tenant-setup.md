## Story
**As a** system architect,
**I want** to implement the core database schema with multi-tenant isolation,
**so that** each shop's data is completely separated and secure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Prisma schema created with User, Shop, Account, Transaction, and FinancialYear models
2. Multi-tenant isolation implemented with shop-based data filtering
3. Bilingual fields (nameAr, nameEn) added to all relevant models
4. Database migrations created and tested
5. Seed data script created for development testing
6. Row-level security policies defined for tenant isolation
7. Database connection pooling configured for performance
8. Indexes created for common query patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundational database setup story.

### Data Models
**Core Models with Relationships** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Shop: Central tenant entity with id, nameAr, nameEn, ownerId, isActive
- User: System users with role (ADMIN/USER), shopId assignment, email authentication
- Account: Hierarchical chart of accounts with bilingual naming, accountType enum, level hierarchy
- Transaction: Financial transactions with type enum, amount/amountPaid/change, debit/credit account references
- FinancialYear: Annual periods with opening/closing stock values, isCurrent/isClosed flags
- Notification: Bilingual notifications with type enum, delivery channels, priority levels
- SyncLog: Audit trail with recordsProcessed, conflictsResolved, duration metrics

**Bilingual Support Requirements** [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- All user-facing content must have Arabic (nameAr) and English (nameEn) fields
- Arabic is the primary language, English is secondary

### Database Schema Specifications
**Prisma Schema Configuration** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- Provider: PostgreSQL with multiSchema and views preview features
- All models use UUID for primary keys with @default(uuid())
- Decimal fields use @db.Decimal(15, 2) for financial precision
- DateTime fields use @default(now()) and @updatedAt
- Enum definitions for all categorical fields

**Multi-tenant Isolation Implementation** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- Every tenant model MUST include shopId field with foreign key to Shop
- Cascade delete configured: Shop deletion removes all related data
- Unique constraints include shopId context (e.g., @@unique([shopId, code]) for accounts)
- Indexes on shopId for all tenant models for query performance

**Required Indexes** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]
- @@index([shopId]) on all tenant models
- @@index([shopId, transactionDate]) for transaction queries
- @@index([userId, isRead]) for notification queries
- @@index([email]) and @@index([lastSyncAt]) for user queries
- @@index([isSynced]) for transaction sync status

### File Locations
**Database Files** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Prisma Schema: `prisma/schema.prisma` (monorepo root) or `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Migrations: `prisma/migrations/` or `apps/api/prisma/migrations/`
- Seed Script: `prisma/seed.ts` or `apps/api/prisma/seed.ts`
- Database Services: `apps/api/src/server/db/`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Database: PostgreSQL 15+
- ORM: Prisma 5.6+ with type-safe database access
- Package Manager: pnpm 8+ for workspace support

**Critical Rules** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Multi-tenant Isolation: Every database query must include shopId filtering
- Type Sharing: Define types in packages/shared and import from there
- Arabic Support: All user-facing strings must have Arabic translations
- Database Tables: Use snake_case naming convention

### Testing Requirements
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend unit tests: Test database models and relationships
- Integration tests: Test multi-tenant data isolation
- Test database operations with different shop contexts
- Verify bilingual field handling

**Test Examples Pattern** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
```typescript
// Test multi-tenant isolation
expect(shopATransactions).not.toContain(shopBTransaction);
// Test bilingual fields
expect(account).toHaveProperty('nameAr');
expect(account).toHaveProperty('nameEn');
```

## Testing
**Test File Location** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Backend tests: `apps/api/tests/unit/` and `apps/api/tests/integration/`
- Database tests should be in `apps/api/tests/unit/db/` or similar

**Testing Framework** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Backend Testing: Vitest + Supertest for API endpoint testing
- Use same test runner as frontend for consistency

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test multi-tenant data isolation with different shopId contexts
- Verify all model relationships work correctly
- Test bilingual field population and retrieval
- Verify all constraints and indexes function properly
- Test seed data creation and cleanup
