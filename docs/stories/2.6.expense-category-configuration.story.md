## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.5 (Cash & Bank Account Setup):
- Multi-tenant isolation patterns established with shopId filtering
- Bilingual UI patterns (Arabic/English) with RTL support implemented
- Audit logging and history tracking patterns working properly
- Financial data management patterns established
- Admin interface patterns for creation/management forms established

### Data Models
**New Model Required** [Based on story requirements and existing patterns]:

**ExpenseCategory Model** [Following established patterns from Account and other models]:
- `id: string (UUID)` - Unique identifier
- `nameAr: string` - Arabic category name
- `nameEn: string` - English category name
- `code: string` - Category code for reference
- `parentId: string` - Parent category reference (for hierarchy)
- `level: number` - Hierarchy level (1=main, 2=sub, 3=detail)
- `shopId: string` - Multi-tenant shop reference
- `isActive: boolean` - Category status
- `isSystemCategory: boolean` - Default categories that cannot be deleted
- `createdAt: DateTime` - Creation timestamp
- `updatedAt: DateTime` - Last modification timestamp

**CategoryAccountAssignment Model** [For linking categories to expense accounts]:
- `id: string (UUID)` - Unique identifier
- `categoryId: string` - Reference to expense category
- `accountId: string` - Reference to expense account
- `shopId: string` - Multi-tenant isolation
- `createdAt: DateTime` - Assignment timestamp

**Database Schema** [Source: architecture/database-schema.md patterns]:
```prisma
model ExpenseCategory {
  id               String    @id @default(uuid())
  nameAr           String
  nameEn           String
  code             String
  parentId         String?
  level            Int       @default(1)
  shopId           String
  isActive         Boolean   @default(true)
  isSystemCategory Boolean   @default(false)
  createdAt        DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt        DateTime  @updatedAt

  shop             Shop      @relation(fields: [shopId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  parent           ExpenseCategory? @relation("CategoryHierarchy", fields: [parentId], references: [id])
  children         ExpenseCategory[] @relation("CategoryHierarchy")
  accountAssignments CategoryAccountAssignment[]

  @@unique([shopId, code])
  @@index([shopId])
  @@index([parentId])
}

model CategoryAccountAssignment {
  id         String    @id @default(uuid())
  categoryId String
  accountId  String
  shopId     String
  createdAt  DateTime  @default(now())

  category   ExpenseCategory @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  account    Account         @relation(fields: [accountId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  shop       Shop            @relation(fields: [shopId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([categoryId, accountId])
  @@index([shopId])
}
```

### API Specifications
**tRPC Router Structure** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]:
- Admin procedures use `adminProcedure` for role-based access control
- All procedures must include shop context validation using ShopContext
- Input validation using Zod schemas with type safety
- Multi-tenant isolation enforced in all database queries
- Follow existing patterns from cashBank router

**New Router: expenseCategoryRouter** [Following existing router patterns]:
- `createExpenseCategory` - Admin-only procedure for category creation
- `updateExpenseCategory` - Admin procedure for category updates
- `deleteExpenseCategory` - Admin procedure with hierarchy validation
- `getExpenseCategories` - Retrieve all categories for shop with hierarchy
- `toggleCategoryStatus` - Admin procedure for activation/deactivation
- `bulkImportCategories` - Admin procedure for template import
- `assignCategoryToAccount` - Link category to expense account
- `getCategoryUsageStats` - Retrieve usage statistics for reporting

### Component Specifications
**Admin Dashboard Context** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Location: `apps/web/src/components/admin/expense-categories/` for specialized components
- Form handling: React Hook Form + Zod validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Bilingual support: Arabic/English labels using next-i18next [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with RTL support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- UI components: shadcn/ui + Headless UI for accessibility [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Component Structure**:
- `ExpenseCategoryForm.tsx` - Category creation and editing with hierarchy
- `CategoryTree.tsx` - Hierarchical display of categories with expand/collapse
- `CategoryList.tsx` - Flat list view with search and filtering
- `BulkImportModal.tsx` - Template import interface
- `CategoryAssignmentModal.tsx` - Assign categories to expense accounts
- `CategoryUsageStats.tsx` - Display usage statistics and reports

### File Locations
**Based on Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- API endpoints: `apps/api/src/server/routers/expense-category.ts` (new router)
- Database repositories: `apps/api/src/server/db/repositories/expenseCategory.ts`
- Database services:
  - `apps/api/src/server/services/category-hierarchy.service.ts`
  - `apps/api/src/server/services/category-usage.service.ts`

- Type definitions: `packages/shared/src/types/expenseCategory.ts`
- Validation schemas: `packages/shared/src/validators/expenseCategory.ts`
- Prisma migration: `apps/api/prisma/migrations/` for new models

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Frontend tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/` and `apps/web/tests/integration/`
- API tests: Using Vitest + Supertest for endpoint testing at `apps/api/tests/unit/routers/`
- E2E tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/` using Playwright with Arabic text support
- All tests must include bilingual interface testing (Arabic/English)
- Hierarchical data structure testing required
- Bulk import functionality testing

**Specific Test Cases Required**:
- Category creation with parent/child hierarchy validation
- Bulk import from template with default categories
- Category-to-account assignment with constraint validation
- Category activation/deactivation with usage tracking
- Usage statistics calculation and reporting
- Bilingual form validation and tree display testing

### Technical Constraints
**Multi-tenant Isolation** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Every database query must include shopId filtering
- All API routes must use standard error handler middleware
- Never mutate state directly - use proper state management patterns
- Hierarchy depth limit (3 levels max) for performance

**Type Safety** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Always define types in packages/shared and import from there
- Never make direct HTTP calls - always use tRPC client service layer
- Access environment variables only through config objects

**Arabic Support** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- All user-facing strings must have Arabic translations
- RTL layout support in Tailwind CSS
- Arabic category names with proper display order

**Hierarchy Management**:
- Prevent circular references in category hierarchy
- Maintain referential integrity when deleting parent categories
- Limit hierarchy depth to 3 levels for UI performance
- Cascade deletion rules for parent/child relationships

### Technology Stack
**Backend**: TypeScript + Next.js API Routes + tRPC + Prisma + PostgreSQL [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Frontend**: TypeScript + Next.js + Headless UI + shadcn/ui + Zustand [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe form validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Internationalization**: next-i18next for Arabic/English support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

## Testing
**Test Organization** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/` for UI components
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/api/` for API endpoint testing
- E2E tests: `apps/web/tests/e2e/` using Playwright framework
- Testing frameworks: Vitest + React Testing Library for frontend, Vitest + Supertest for backend
- All tests must include Arabic interface testing and hierarchy manipulation
- Specific test requirement: Bilingual category management and bulk import validation

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Expense category CRUD operations with hierarchy validation
- Bulk import from template with default category creation
- Category-to-account assignment with multi-tenant isolation
- Usage statistics calculation and reporting accuracy
- Hierarchy management (parent/child relationships, circular reference prevention)
