## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 (Daily Entries Dashboard) established the dashboard infrastructure with real-time balance updates, TransactionList component, and tRPC procedures for dashboard data. The modal framework and state management patterns are available, and the transaction display system supports color-coded transaction types (Sales=green).

### Data Models
**Transaction Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Transaction]
- Core fields: `id`, `type` (SALES/PURCHASE/EXPENSE/TRANSFER), `amount`, `amountPaid`, `change`
- `transactionDate` defaults to current date/time
- `description` for transaction details and invoice comments
- `accountId` links to customer account (default: "direct-sales-{shopId}")
- `counterAccountId` for dual-entry accounting (Cash or Bank account based on payment method)
- `shopId` for multi-tenant isolation (CRITICAL: Every query must include)
- `userId` links to current authenticated user
- `isSynced` and `syncedAt` for offline sync status tracking

**Account Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Account]
- Customer accounts have bilingual names: `nameAr`, `nameEn`
- Account hierarchy with `parentId` and `level` properties
- `accountType` includes ASSET (for Cash/Bank) and LIABILITY (for customer credit)
- Default customer account pattern: "direct-sales-{shopId}" for walk-in sales

**Shop Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Shop]
- `id` used in shopId filtering for all queries
- Bilingual naming: `nameAr`, `nameEn` for customer account defaults

### API Specifications
**transactions.create** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#transactions.create]
- Input schema includes type, amount, amountPaid, change, description, accountId, counterAccountId, transactionDate
- Returns created Transaction with all relationships populated
- Performs dual-entry accounting: debits customer account, credits revenue account
- Updates account balances atomically using database transactions

**accounts.getCustomers** (New procedure needed)
- Input: `{ shopId: string, searchTerm?: string }`
- Returns: Array of customer accounts with current balances
- Must include default "direct-sales-{shopId}" in results

### Component Specifications
**Transaction Modal Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component-Organization]
- Modal components go in `apps/web/src/components/features/transactions/`
- Use shadcn/ui Dialog component as foundation
- Follow established modal patterns from dashboard components
- Support Arabic RTL layout and bilingual form labels

**Form Handling Standards** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe form validation
- Payment calculation logic must be real-time and client-side
- Form state management through Zustand store integration

### File Locations
- Transaction modal: `apps/web/src/components/features/transactions/TransactionEntryModal.tsx`
- Sales form: `apps/web/src/components/features/transactions/SalesTransactionForm.tsx`
- Transaction router: `apps/api/src/server/routers/transaction.ts` (extend existing)
- Transaction service: `apps/api/src/server/services/transaction.service.ts` (extend existing)
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/transactions/`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/transactions/`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests using Vitest + React Testing Library
- Test Arabic text input and validation messages
- Mock tRPC client for API testing with realistic data
- Test offline scenarios using service worker mocks
- Payment calculation edge cases must have comprehensive test coverage
- Multi-tenant isolation testing with different shopIds

### Technical Constraints
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: EVERY database query must include shopId [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use shared types from packages/shared [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **API Calls**: Only use tRPC client, never direct HTTP [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Arabic Support**: All form labels and validation messages need translations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Offline First**: All transactions must handle offline state and sync queue [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate state directly, use proper Zustand patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Form Validation**: Use React Hook Form + Zod for consistent validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `apps/web/tests/` directory structure
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- Form testing patterns: Test user interactions, validation messages, and submission flows
- Arabic testing: Include RTL layout tests, Arabic text input, and bilingual validation messages
- Payment calculation testing: Test all scenarios (exact, over, under, zero payment)
- Integration testing: Test complete transaction creation workflow with tRPC integration
- Offline testing: Mock service worker for offline transaction storage and sync
- Coverage requirements: Minimum 80% code coverage for transaction components
