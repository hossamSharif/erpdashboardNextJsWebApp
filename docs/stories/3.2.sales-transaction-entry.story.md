## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 (Daily Entries Dashboard) established the dashboard infrastructure with real-time balance updates, TransactionList component, and tRPC procedures for dashboard data. The modal framework and state management patterns are available, and the transaction display system supports color-coded transaction types (Sales=green).

### Data Models
**Transaction Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Transaction]
- Core fields: `id`, `type` (SALES/PURCHASE/EXPENSE/TRANSFER), `amount`, `amountPaid`, `change`
- `transactionDate` defaults to current date/time
- `description` for transaction details and invoice comments
- `accountId` links to customer account (default: "direct-sales-{shopId}")
- `counterAccountId` for dual-entry accounting (Cash or Bank account based on payment method)
- `shopId` for multi-tenant isolation (CRITICAL: Every query must include)
- `userId` links to current authenticated user
- `isSynced` and `syncedAt` for offline sync status tracking

**Account Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Account]
- Customer accounts have bilingual names: `nameAr`, `nameEn`
- Account hierarchy with `parentId` and `level` properties
- `accountType` includes ASSET (for Cash/Bank) and LIABILITY (for customer credit)
- Default customer account pattern: "direct-sales-{shopId}" for walk-in sales

**Shop Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Shop]
- `id` used in shopId filtering for all queries
- Bilingual naming: `nameAr`, `nameEn` for customer account defaults

### API Specifications
**transactions.create** [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#transactions.create]
- Input schema includes type, amount, amountPaid, change, description, accountId, counterAccountId, transactionDate
- Returns created Transaction with all relationships populated
- Performs dual-entry accounting: debits customer account, credits revenue account
- Updates account balances atomically using database transactions

**accounts.getCustomers** (New procedure needed)
- Input: `{ shopId: string, searchTerm?: string }`
- Returns: Array of customer accounts with current balances
- Must include default "direct-sales-{shopId}" in results

### Component Specifications
**Transaction Modal Architecture** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component-Organization]
- Modal components go in `apps/web/src/components/features/transactions/`
- Use shadcn/ui Dialog component as foundation
- Follow established modal patterns from dashboard components
- Support Arabic RTL layout and bilingual form labels

**Form Handling Standards** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe form validation
- Payment calculation logic must be real-time and client-side
- Form state management through Zustand store integration

### File Locations
- Transaction modal: `apps/web/src/components/features/transactions/TransactionEntryModal.tsx`
- Sales form: `apps/web/src/components/features/transactions/SalesTransactionForm.tsx`
- Transaction router: `apps/api/src/server/routers/transaction.ts` (extend existing)
- Transaction service: `apps/api/src/server/services/transaction.service.ts` (extend existing)
- Unit tests: `apps/web/tests/unit/components/transactions/`
- Integration tests: `apps/web/tests/integration/transactions/`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Unit tests using Vitest + React Testing Library
- Test Arabic text input and validation messages
- Mock tRPC client for API testing with realistic data
- Test offline scenarios using service worker mocks
- Payment calculation edge cases must have comprehensive test coverage
- Multi-tenant isolation testing with different shopIds

### Technical Constraints
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: EVERY database query must include shopId [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Type Safety**: Use shared types from packages/shared [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **API Calls**: Only use tRPC client, never direct HTTP [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Arabic Support**: All form labels and validation messages need translations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Offline First**: All transactions must handle offline state and sync queue [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **State Updates**: Never mutate state directly, use proper Zustand patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Form Validation**: Use React Hook Form + Zod for consistent validation [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: `apps/web/tests/` directory structure
- Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- Form testing patterns: Test user interactions, validation messages, and submission flows
- Arabic testing: Include RTL layout tests, Arabic text input, and bilingual validation messages
- Payment calculation testing: Test all scenarios (exact, over, under, zero payment)
- Integration testing: Test complete transaction creation workflow with tRPC integration
- Offline testing: Mock service worker for offline transaction storage and sync
- Coverage requirements: Minimum 80% code coverage for transaction components

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

Story 3.2 implementation has been reviewed against all acceptance criteria. The frontend components and user interface implementation is complete and follows established patterns. However, several critical backend implementation gaps prevent the story from functioning properly.

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**
- ✅ AC 1-9: All UI requirements implemented correctly
- ❌ Backend API integration incomplete
- ❌ Critical service methods missing

**Testing Coverage:**
- ✅ Unit tests: 210 test cases covering modal and form components
- ✅ Integration tests: Comprehensive workflow testing with mocked APIs
- ❌ End-to-end functionality blocked by missing backend implementation

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ TypeScript integration with proper Zod validation
- ✅ Consistent component architecture and UI patterns
- ✅ Arabic/English bilingual support throughout
- ❌ Runtime errors expected due to missing API methods
