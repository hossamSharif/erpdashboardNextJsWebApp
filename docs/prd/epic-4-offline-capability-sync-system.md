1: Auto-sync triggers when connection restored
2: Sync attempts every 4 hours when online
3: Background sync for mobile app
4: Progress indicator during sync
5: Sync queue with priority ordering

7: Sync retry with exponential backoff
8: Sync cancellation option
9: Bandwidth-efficient delta sync

## Story 4.4: 24-Hour Mandatory Sync Policy

1: Track time since last successful sync
2: Warning notification at 20 hours without sync
3: Alert notification at 23 hours
4: Block new transactions after 24 hours until sync
5: Force sync dialog that cannot be dismissed
6: Admin notification when user exceeds 24 hours
7: Sync timer resets only on successful sync
8: Override option for admin in emergencies
9: Clear messaging about sync requirements

## Story 4.5: Conflict Resolution System
**As a** system,
**I want** to resolve data conflicts automatically,
**so that** data integrity is maintained.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Last-write-wins strategy implementation
2: Conflict detection for same record edits
3: Audit trail of conflict resolutions
4: Conflicted data backup before resolution
5: Server timestamp authority for conflicts
6: Duplicate transaction prevention
7: Balance reconciliation after conflicts
8: Admin notification for critical conflicts
9: Conflict resolution report generation

## Story 4.6: Sync History & Monitoring
**As a** user,
**I want** to see my sync history,
**so that** I know my data is safely backed up.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Sync history page in settings
2: Last sync timestamp display
3: Data volume synced (records count)
4: Sync duration tracking
5: Success/failure status for each sync
6: Failed sync reason logging
7: Sync history for last 30 days
8: Export sync logs option
9: Clear visual sync status indicators

## Story 4.7: Admin Sync Monitoring Dashboard
**As an** admin,
**I want** to monitor all user sync operations,
**so that** I can ensure data consistency.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Real-time sync status for all users
2: Users with pending sync highlight
3: Sync compliance percentage metrics
4: Alert for users approaching 24-hour limit
5: Force sync trigger for specific users
6: Sync failure pattern analysis
7: Data volume metrics per shop
8: Historical sync performance charts
9: Export sync reports for compliance

## Story 4.8: Optimistic UI Updates
**As a** shop worker,
**I want** immediate UI feedback for my actions,
**so that** the app feels responsive even offline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1: Immediate UI updates on transaction save
2: Optimistic balance calculations
3: Visual indicator for pending sync items
4: Rollback UI on sync failure
5: Smooth animations for state changes
6: Queue position indicator for pending items
