# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable centralized financial management across multiple spare parts shops with real-time visibility
- Automate profit margin calculations based on opening and ending stock values
- Provide offline-first mobile solution for shop floor operations with seamless sync
- Implement role-based access control separating admin (shop owners) and user (shop workers) capabilities
- Support multi-currency financial reporting with daily exchange rate updates
- Deliver automated daily financial reporting with comprehensive notification system
- Reduce manual accounting errors by 75% through digital transformation
- Achieve 80% daily active user adoption with 95% daily report compliance

## Background Context
The spare parts retail industry currently relies on manual financial tracking methods that lead to inconsistent reporting, delayed profit visibility, and difficulty monitoring worker performance across multiple shop locations. Shop owners need real-time insight into profitability through accurate stock value tracking and automated profit calculations. This PRD defines a comprehensive mobile-first accounting application specifically designed for multi-shop spare parts businesses, addressing the critical need for standardized financial management with robust offline capabilities to ensure uninterrupted operations regardless of network connectivity.

The solution leverages modern web technologies through the T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma) to deliver a unified codebase serving both web and mobile platforms, significantly reducing development complexity while ensuring type safety and maintainability across the entire application stack.
