# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Multi-Shop Spare Parts Accounting App**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD analysis, this project explicitly specifies the **T3 Stack** as the foundation:

**Selected Foundation:** T3 Stack (Next.js + TypeScript + tRPC + Prisma)
**Project Type:** Greenfield monorepo architecture
**Pre-configured Choices:**
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- tRPC for end-to-end type-safe APIs
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL

- Tailwind CSS with RTL support

**Architectural Constraints:**
- Must support Arabic-first UI with RTL layout
- Offline-first mobile capability with React Native/Expo
- Multi-tenant architecture with shop-based data isolation
- 24-hour mandatory sync policy
