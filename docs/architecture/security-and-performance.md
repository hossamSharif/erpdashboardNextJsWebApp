# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers for XSS prevention
- Secure storage for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization

**Backend Security:**
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Multi-tenant data isolation

**Authentication Security:**
- JWT tokens with secure storage
- Session management with timeouts
- Password complexity requirements

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle size target: < 200KB initial JS
- Route-based code splitting
- Service worker caching

**Backend Performance:**
- Response time target: < 200ms P95
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching with TTL
