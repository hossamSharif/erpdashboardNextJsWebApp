- PostgreSQL 15+ for data storage
- Zod for schema validation
- JWT for authentication
- Redis for caching and sessions

## Development Notes

This package will be fully implemented in upcoming stories focusing on backend API development. The current setup provides the basic package structure to integrate with the monorepo and establishes the planned technology stack.
